# Image-Caption-Generator-with-High-Accuracy

Created by altering the traditional cnn-lstm method. Predicting the words for image using cnn . Using bidirectional lstm and attention mechanism to give a meaningful sentence for predicted words and gives more accuracy than existing methodologies...
 
 Additionally, I created a web application using Python Flask, where HTML pages and Flask's render_template are employed for efficient user interaction.

STEPS : 

1.) Import all the necessary packages
2.) Connect with Drive to access dataset
3.) Pre - Processing Data : 
     * Load the Data
     * Clean th Data
     * Tokenize the Descriptions
     * Data Generator
4.) Generate a description for an image
5.) Evaluate the Model
6.) Load Test Features
7.) Add Attention Mechanism
8.) Add Bi-Directional LSTM in Model
9.) Train the model, run epochs manually and save after each epoch
10.) Evaluate the model
